      role: "restaurants situated right next to Lake Merritt", 
      description: "The Lake Chalet Seafood Bar & Grill and The Grand Lake Kitchen are both waterfront restaurants situated right next to Lake Merritt.",
      contribution: "The Lake Chalet Seafood Bar & Grill stated that people loved to see the lake from afar, but there has been a decline in lake-side activity due to water cleanliness issues hindering the lake’s allure. The Grand Lake Kitchen stated that if the lake was cleaner, there would likely be more people visiting the lake and likely their restaurant as well. They both expressed support for reducing antibiotic resistant bacteria in the lake to address health risks and unpleasant odors that deter visitors, which has been a communal effort for years. They viewed a synthetic biology approach positively, as long as it posed no threat to the water or the creatures and people it interacts with.",

        contribution: "Representatives of Children’s Fairyland see visitors who appreciate the picturesque lake but refrain from water contact due to its known water quality issues. They believed that reducing the amount of antibiotic resistant bacteria would be a benefit for the community and that a cleaner lake would attract more visitors. They expressed support for the idea of using synthetic biology as a solution but emphasized the need for additional lake cleaning before people can fully interact with the water.",
        adjustments: "This conversation reminded us that while our project will not enable people to fully enjoy the Lake, “cleaning the lake” of pathogens will still attract visitors and enhance local businesses; therefore, ARC is a step in the right direction.",

        contribution: "Leah spoke of how they stress that their customers do not touch the water, as the lake’s poor water quality is well-known. She expressed her desire for a cleaner and more interactive lake. Vass praised our efforts to use synthetic biology as a way to clean up the lake, a goal long supported by the community. She also believed a synthetic biology solution improving the lake’s interaction would enhance tourism and recommended reaching out to others who also work with and around the lake.",
        adjustments: "Our discussion illuminated the community’s awareness of the lake’s water quality issues, how it hinders community interaction and activity, and the locals’ universal desire for improved water quality. Ms. Vass also directed us toward the Lake Merritt Rowing Club for our HP efforts.",

        contribution: "They acknowledged the water’s uncleanness and spoke of how they ensured that only their paddles touched the water. After contextualizing the antibiotic resistance issue and its impact on the environment and our health, the club supported the idea of reducing antibiotic resistant bacteria in the lake to improve the water quality and reduce associated health risks, given their frequent water interactions.",
        adjustments: "Their input reinforced the words of previous local stakeholders by emphasizing the need for safety, particularly for residents who directly interact with the lake. This, along with advice from Dr. Trounce, led us to explore phage–human interactions and control systems with Dr. Bollyky and Dr. Relman.",

        adjustments: "The Gardens highlighted the connection between Lake Merritt’s water quality, local business revenue, and the wellbeing of another important stakeholder—the wildlife that inhabit. Therefore, it is imperative our safety efforts encompass both humans and animals.",
