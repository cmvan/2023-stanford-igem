      description: "Dr. Milana Boukhman Trounce, MD MBA is a Clinical Professor of Emergency Medicine at Stanford University and Director of the Stanford Biosecurity Program. Given her unique perspectives as a biosecurity expert and medical professional, we contacted her to identify needs within the antibiotic resistance crisis.",
      contribution: "Dr. Trounce stressed the urgency of the antibiotic resistance crisis, particularly the spread of multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis (MR–TB) in Eastern Europe. Clinically, she recognized that there are not many treatment options for bacterial infections besides other antibiotics. This inevitably broadens the resistance spectrum, diminishing antibiotic efficacy. Regarding biosecurity, she highlighted dual-use research and genetically engineered “super phages” as concerns. To combat this, she recommends minimizing phage–human interactions and implementing control mechanisms.",
      adjustments: "Dr. Trounce illuminated the urgency of the antibiotic resistance crisis and the “gap” in solutions that our project could fill—providing a technology that would improve antibiotic stewardship and would not contribute to the antibiotic resistance spectrum. Dr. Trounce also motivated us to heavily prioritize end user safety. This motivated our discussions with 1) Dr. Paul Bollyky on phage–human interactions and 2) Dr. David Relman on potential microbiome perturbations as well as mechanisms for our control system.",

        description: "Dr. Vivek Mutalik, PhD is a Staff Scientist in the Environmental Genomics & Systems Biology Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He has previously conducted wastewater studies at EBMUD. He also leads the Phage Foundry, which provides phage-based countermeasures against antibiotic resistant bacteria.[4] We contacted him regarding requirements for an effective bio-solution for antibiotic resistance.",
        contribution: "Echoing Dr. Trounce, Dr. Mutalik emphasized the importance of a solution that does not broaden the antibiotic resistance spectrum. He also highlighted the scientific and federal interest in the use of phages that complement antibiotics effectively.",
        adjustments: "Dr. Mutalik highlighted the viability of phage research to combat antibiotic resistance, which encouraged us to contact the CDC Biofilm Laboratory (below) to further discuss their research in phages and how we could potentially test our technology in-situ.",

We also spoke to members Dr. Ariel Santiago, PhD; Dr. Maria Burgos-Garay, PhD, MASCP, CLS; and Dr. Rodney M. Donlan, PhD.",
        contribution: "The team emphasized the need for our solution to be selective in targeting bacteria, preventing complete eradication to avoid colonization by pathogenic colonies after treatment. They provided suggestions for in vitro switch testing, including using basic E. coli strains for our proof-of-concept, scaling down their model system to a benchtop level, and consideration of a continual “closed-looped” phage system.",
        adjustments: "The Biofilm Laboratory confirmed the importance of sub-host specificity in our project’s real-world application, given its interaction with complex microbial communities. This encouraged us to both design and test our switches in vitro, which led to our interactions with Dr. Grant Rybnicky and Christian Choe for specific guidance on switch testing and riboswitches design, respectively.",

        contribution: "For our Lake Merritt project, Dr. Newman’s insights as an epidemiologist led us to focus not only on existing contamination but also on its sources for long-term success. This meant identifying antibiotic resistance gene reservoirs and preventing their spread. Furthermore, Dr. Newman emphasized the importance of engaging with the broader community and practicing science communication to achieve this. Dr. Newman also spoke about his 2015 UCSF initiative, identifying how improper preparation of meat containing antibiotics can promote antibiotic resistance upon consumption, the implications of which are amplified in a hospital setting.",
        adjustments: "His advice inspired us to shift our project’s focus toward contamination sources, explore phage applications in wastewater treatment and agriculture, and collaborate with EBMUD for future Implementation involving wastewater matrices.",
